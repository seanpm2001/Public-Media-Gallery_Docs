Public image library and gallery

A place to store recommended images/videos/audio of yourself, for use exclusively in news articles, press appearances, and other reports. All images here should be either public domain or Copyleft licensed (no exceptions for Copyright licenses like Creative Commons, MIT, and others) These media pieces are for anyone to use when reporting on you. You can also leave a note and tell them to use another image outside of the gallery if they think it fits well, but also make a disclaimer that it isn't always recommended (for the people who use Copyright, a warning should also be placed that usage outside of the public image gallery can be risky)
